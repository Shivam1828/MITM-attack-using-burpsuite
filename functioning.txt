USING BURPSUIT FOR MITM
In order to perform man in the middle attack using burpsuit, we first need to install burp suit in our system.(burpsuit comes inbuilt in kali linux)
we can install burpsuit from the given website-
https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/download-and-install

After installation we need to open burpsuit and then we have to start   NEW PROJECT in it.
Now we have to select default configurations for the project and then we have to click on START BURP button.
now we'll select proxy option from the rows of options given above.
and then we have to check wheather the intercept is turned on or not by clicking on the intercept button.
Then click on open browser option and thus a new browser will open up.

now each and every request traveling from the browser is captured in the burp suit 

and now we can perform a man in the middle attack by configuring the traffic between the server and the site.\
